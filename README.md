# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

I took a pre-existing website for Horiseon Social Solution Services and reorganized it. I added a title to appear in the site tab, updated the element selectors to reflect modern HTML semantics, ensured headers were listed sequentially, and added alt . I also organized the css stylesheet. I put each element in the order of the html index elements, and got rid of redundant elements. This will make the site more accessible to screen readers and similar technology.
